# Motivation
### Background
* Coconut cultivation and its associated industries constitute pivotal components of economic activity in many tropical regions.
* Several products are derived from distinct categories of coconuts, including those in their young, mature, and old stages.
    
### Pain point
* Contemporary coconut farming practices heavily rely on traditional methods for assessing maturity, differentiating between young, mature, and old stages.
* The widespread use of manual assessments proves labor-intensive and poses efficiency challenges as coconut quantities escalate.
    
### Objective
* Develop a computer vision-based coconut maturity classification system.
* This system expects:
    * Facilitating decision-making in coconut processing industries. 
    * Reducing human labor and error in coconut quality assessment.

# Dataset
Link dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IoUpBAI8BWnbe_s-eyFtMbCO16AEHO8b?usp=sharing

### Data Source:
* The primary source of data for this project encompasses information derived from both online repositories, specifically Roboflow and Kaggle, and real-world datasets. The online repositories, Roboflow and Kaggle, offer a wealth of curated data. In parallel, real-world datasets supplement this digital information, ensuring the inclusion of authentic and varied instances.
* Sample data:

### Data Augmentation
* Augmentation on 'Young Coconut' class:
------------------------------------
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(): Apply random horizontal flip to the image with a default probability of 0.5
    transforms.RandomRotation(10): Apply random rotation to the image with a rotation range of Â±10 degrees
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224, scale=(0.8, 1.0)): Apply random resized crop to the image, resizing it to 224x224, with a scale factor between 0.8 and 1.0
    transforms.RandomAffine(degrees=0, translate=(0.1, 0.1)): Apply random affine transformation to the image with a rotation range of 0 degrees and translation of 0.1 in both directions
    transforms.RandomPerspective(distortion_scale=0.2, p=0.5): Apply random perspective transformation to the image with a distortion scale of 0.2 and a probability of 0.5

* Augmentation on the whole dataset:
------------------------------------
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.1),
    transforms.RandomVerticalFlip(p=0.1),
    transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=15),
    transforms.ColorJitter(
        brightness=0.2,
        contrast=0.2,
        saturation=0.2,
        hue=0.2
    ),
    transforms.GaussianBlur(kernel_size=3),
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(size=224, scale=(0.8, 1)),
    transforms.RandomGrayscale(p=0.1),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
